## Construction material recognition on PyTorch

I have been using OpenCV and Tensorflow Lite on Android for some projects at work. But, this time I want to run AI on my PC, with my custom datasets.

This project uses [Detecto (based on PyTorch)](https://github.com/alankbi/detecto) for both training custom datasets and inferencing.

I have used Colab to train the network with my custom datasets:
[PTH file](python/model_weights.pth)

Here is a notebook of object detection test script with the PTH file.
